A simple shooting game implemented with PyGame and OpenGL.

It currently only uses the mouse, but I toyed around with using a Wii-mote too, so some test code relative to that is still in the codebase.

Dependencies Not Included In Codebase:

  * Python 2.6+ - http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/
  * PyGame      - http://www.pygame.org/
  * PyOpenGL    - http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/
